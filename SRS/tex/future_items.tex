Currently, the Interactive Degree Planner is solely a web-based application targeting students from Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Texas at Arlington. Therefore, we are expecting to expand the service in the future, such as providing detail degree planner for majors other than CSE and making an mobile application of this.

\subsection{Non-CSE Degree Planner}
\subsubsection{Description}
We hope to make the application available to all departments at UTA, so that all students are able to acknowledge their academic paths in the easier, faster, and more efficient way.

\subsection{Mobile Application}
\subsubsection{Description}
Due to constraints of time, skills, and feasibility analysis, we decide not to focus on the mobile application for now. However, this is a potential development in the future, which allows users to access to the service easier.
