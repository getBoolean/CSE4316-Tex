\subsection{Features \& Functions}
% What the product does and does not do. Specify in words what it looks
% like, referring to a conceptual diagram/graphic (Figure X).  Define
% the principle parts/components of the product. Specify the elements
% in the diagram/graphic that are part(s) of this product as well as
% any associated external elements (e.g., the Internet, an external
% web server, a GPS satellite, etc.)

The screen is divided into two parts, the website banner, the side
panel and the main screen. The side panel has a button to select a
major, a search bar, and the list of classes. The main screen has
the list of semesters and which classes the student has selected
for each. The website banner has the website logo, title, and
a button to go to the accounts page.

Accounts page where users can sign in, sign out, and reset password.
Users can create an account so that they can access their degree plan
from any device.

In the side panel, show a list of classes which are draggable,
and visually show which classes are required by the degree plan.
Choosing a major will show which classes are required for the student
to take. The classes can also be searched using the search bar above the list.

On the main screen, show a row of semesters which classes can be dragged to.
The list of semesters can be horizonally scrolled to show more semesters, and
have buttons to scroll for the user.
Classes are chosen by dragging and droping classes to the semester box.
There will be an error shown to the user if they choosen a class
without having the co-reg or pre-req class.

\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
Describe critical external data flows. What does your product
require/expect to receive from end users or external systems (inputs),
and what is expected to be created by your product for consumption by
end users or external systems (outputs)? In other words, specify here
all data/information to flow into and out of your systems. A table
works best here, with rows for each critical data element, and columns
for name, description and use.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
Specify what all operational (visible) interfaces look like to your
end-user, administrator, maintainer, etc. Show sample/mocked-up screen shots,
graphics of buttons, panels, etc. Refer to the critical external inputs
and outputs described in the paragraph above.
