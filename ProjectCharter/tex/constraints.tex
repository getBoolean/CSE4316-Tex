The following list contains key constraints related to the implementation and testing of the project.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This creates a bullet list. To add a bullet, use the \item command.
% Make sure it is between the \begin{itemize} and \end{itemize} commands.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The degree plan will be only for CSE students so that the project can be feasible.
  \item App will not update what classes user has taken previously as that would be done manually by the user, since we won't have access to such data.
  \item Need to make this app only web/desktop specific and not multi-platform due to time constraint
  \item We will be manually entering the data for the degree planner without access to the UTA database.
  \item Will need to start designing the database and logic for implementing the features of the application by end of Senior Design 1 to stay on schedule.
\end{itemize}
