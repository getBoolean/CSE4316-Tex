The project mainly focuses on building a web-based application, which relies on software, database, and networking tools. The budget of building the website can be broken down into two fundamental components: a home, which is the web domain, and an infrastructure, which is the web hosting. We plan to buy the domain name when the project is done at the end of the semester. To build the more practical website, the web hosting will consume most of the budget.
