We are going to build an app that will help students plan their classes. It will give them the option to drag and drop classes, and this way they can make their degree plan. It will be interactive as in if the students select a class that requires another class then they wont be able to add that ahead of the class that is the pre req. It will also be able to handle co req so that they can take that class and a higher level class at the same time. This will help mitigate students that are confused about which classes they need next and it will help plan their college degree better.
