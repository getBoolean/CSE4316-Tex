The stakeholders are Professor Conly and Professor Mcmurrough. The point of contact will be from our team to Professor Conly. If there is anything that needs to be communicated to Professor Mcmurrough it will be done by our team members to professor mcmurrough or it will go through Professor Conly. 

The team members and their respective roles are:

    Safi Ullah- front end
    
    
    Ijaz Umar-front end
    
    
    Daniel Newville-backend
    
    
    Le Uyen Nguyen-backend
    
    Right now the roles arent finalized, however we are all working together to see if anybody wants a different role that they will be better suited in. 
    The responsibilities are simple. Everyone must work on parts that contribute to the project. We are going to meet up and divide up the work together and once that is done we will set a timeline for when we want the work done. Usually the deadline will be a couple days ahead of the last day of the sprint, that way we can iron things up. We will try our best to communicate with one another and make sure that we dont fail to mention any details that may be vital to the success of the project.
