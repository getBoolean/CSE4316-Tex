The reason behind taking up this project is that the current UTA degree planner is not user friendly nor does it give users an interactive environment to easily choose their classes. Users need to be able to easily choose classes to plan out their classes to finish their degree in a timely manner. The best way to do that is to eliminate any confusion while users plan it out. This is why we chose this project, since as students we also understand the need of a proper degree planner, which checks if prerequisites are met, let the user know if they're missing something, and overall a easy User Interface to plan out the classes. Moreover, as former freshman students, we understand the confusion that there maybe in knowing what classes can I take this semester and finding the flowchart hard to follow, therefore, the goal of this app is to aid to the needs of these new students and give them a solid idea of how to plan out their four year degree, and give them the confidence as they would know that they are on track.\\

The customer of this project is Professor Chris Conly. He wants us to work on this project because he feel's that an interactive degree planner with options such as drag and drop, will help users visualize their classes much easily than the traditional one. Furthermore, as our professor and the students are Computer Science and Engineering students, the focus of the degree planner will be to specifically meet the needs of those students alone, so that this project can be feasible.
