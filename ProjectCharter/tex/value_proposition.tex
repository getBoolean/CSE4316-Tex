This project will make it much easier for Freshman students to plan out their degrees.

The University will benefit from this because Advisors will be able to spend less time
    planning degree plans for students because they will be able to do it themselves easily.
    Advisors can also use this project to quickly check if a student's request classes are
    missing any pre-reqs or co-reqs.
