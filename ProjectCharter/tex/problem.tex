Many students at UTA come in and have a hard time following the degree plan that is given to them by their adivisors. If the students had a way to track their progress and know what stage they are at in their degree plan, then it can help make it easier for them to graduate and complete their degree plan. In addition, advisors have a tough job and they are busy a lot. This degree planner can help take the load off advisors and give the students an alternate way to plan their degree plan without having to wait for advisors to respond or to meet with them on their scheduled data. Finally, the degree plan will allow to students to even adjust their plan. Wether they want to take extra classes or if they want to graduate early the degree planner will help them calculate that and give them an illustration of what they would have to do to meet their timeline.
