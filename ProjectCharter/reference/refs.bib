The learning process for pharmacists must enable the skillful harnessing of metacognition, critical thinking, and effective application of specialized skills. This study assessed the impact of self-developed academic goals and study plans on pharmacy students' academic performance and perception of learning experience in a developing setting.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted at the College of Clinical Pharmacy, King Faisal University, KSA, in a compulsory 4th year course (Pharmacy management). The study group was exposed to goal setting and study planning while the control group had only routine teaching and learning activities planned for the course. Academic performance was determined with quizzes, midterm, and final exams, and the percentage achievement for the course objectives. An end-of-course evaluation, with a pre-tested questionnaire, was used to assess the perception of learning experience.
Results
The study group constituted 41.4% (29), while 58.6% (41) were in the control group, with a mean ± SD age of 22.9 (SD = 3.2) and 21.6 (SD = 6.1) years, respectively. The mean ± SD scores for quizzes (8.4 (SD = 2.2), mid-term (21.9 (SD = 3.7), and final exams (42.8 (SD = 5.3), and the percentage achievement for the course objectives A (77%) and B (78%) were significantly higher in the study group (P < 0.001). The end-of-course feedbacks showed key differences in the perception of learning experience between the study and control groups.
Conclusion
Personalized goal setting and study planning appeared to significantly improve continuous engagement with learning, focus on academic goals, and academic performance.}
